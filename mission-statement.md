# Lambda Transit Mission Statement

Lambda Transit aims to improve the customer experience of rail-based mass transit such that private transportation feels inadequate by comparison.

Lambda Transit aims to do this by providing:
* a system in which a customer knows all variables.
* a seemless payment experience
* a visibly pleasant environment in which to exist.
* an olfactorily pleasant environment in which to exist.
* short wait times
* expedient travel times.
